# Base-FlappyBirdClone-UnrealEngine-5.1.1
This is the base for a Flappy Bird Clone Game made with Unreal Engine Blue Print system
These are the Basic functions of the Flappy Bird Game, you can add your own variation to it
The Coin function was kinda broken and I couldn't find what was the problem of the code, feel free to tell me if you find it out
